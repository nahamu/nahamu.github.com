Just a list of some SmartOS wiki pages I've spent a lot of time working on.
 1. [Simple PXE Server](http://wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/Simple+PXE+Server)
 1. [Spice on SmartOS](http://wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/Spice+on+SmartOS)

Also, this blog (such as it is) has been added to the [NetworkBoot.org blog roll](http://networkboot.org/planet/).
I probably won't write a whole lot of PXE related posts, but I look forward to the broader exposure if/when I do!
People finding this post from that avenue might enjoy this page: [PXE Booting SmartOS](http://wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/PXE+Booting+SmartOS)
